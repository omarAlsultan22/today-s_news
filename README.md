## Today's News App (Flutter)

📰 A modern news application delivering personalized content with smooth browsing and smart features to boost user engagement.

## 🚀 Key Achievements

• 35% increase in user engagement after implementing bookmark/save-for-later functionality

• Optimized content discovery with instant search and category filters

• Seamless reading experience with pagination and smooth scroll performance

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

• State Management: BLoC pattern for efficient data flow

• Data Fetching: REST API integration with Dio/HTTP

• Pagination: Load more news items dynamically as users scroll

• Search & Filters: Fast client-side search with debounce and API filtering

• Local Storage: Hive or SharedPreferences for bookmarks/offline reading

##📱 Core Features

• Trending, breaking, and category-based news

• Bookmark/save articles for later

• Dark/Light mode support

• Pull-to-refresh and infinite scroll

• Clean, responsive UI with smooth animations

## 🌟 Why This App Stands Out

• Focus on performance (no lag when loading new pages)

• Personalized experience (save favorites, search history)

• Engagement-focused design (easy sharing, readable layout)
